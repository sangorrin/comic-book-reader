IMPORTANT - macOS Users
========================

Due to macOS security (Gatekeeper), you may see an error saying the app is "damaged"
when you try to open it. This is because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer
certificate.

TO FIX THIS open Terminal and run:

    xattr -cr "/Applications/ACBR Comic Book Reader.app"

(Adjust the path if you installed it elsewhere)
